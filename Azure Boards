Integrating GitHub with Azure Boards
Integrating GitHub with Azure Boards
Commit to Azure Board, you need the spring ID 
E.g. Commit message AB#1 
AB#1 = AB for Azure Boards, #1 = Sprint ID.


How do I tell Azure Boards that the first Development is created?
Try the following:
Completed AB#1
Developed AB#1
Fixed AB#1
